5. Directories and Search Engines

These are among the most important resources as they provide the researcher a vast choice of search tools. While key sites are listed below, be aware of ones that have collected URLS to multiple search engines.

Quick Find It: http://www.quickfindit.com
Search Engine Colossus: http://www.searchenginecolossus.com/
Search Engine Guide/Search Engines Directory: http://www.searchengineguide.com/searchengines.html
Search-22: http://www.search-22.com

There are also regional or subject-specialized search engines, sites which concentrate on a smaller area. Many regional ones may be found through the following:

8. Directories

Search directories are similar to search engines. They list key sites containing information about a site, but the similarity ends there. Humans create search directories, and they have looked at the material before linking to it. In contrast, search engine robot use programmed search criteria to find and bring back URLs.

Usually someone who at least claims knowledge of a subject has evaluated the material in a search directory. Also, search directories are much smaller than search engine databases. Good ones, produced by specialists in their field, may be useful. The quality of any particular directory depends in large part on the expertise of those who made the search directory and the way the experts crafted their original search terms. Search directories are most useful for giving an overall view of a subject. They seldom will provide the material a researcher can “drill down” to detailed information.




Search directories are not as popular as search engines. For the most part, Web researchers seldom stray from search engines to subject directories, though the research progression often works the other way around. Directories are falling out of style and closing down. They are labor-intensive compared to search engines, which keep working as they are automated.

Colorado
Sandra Fish fishnette@gmail.com started this but maybe not much help - I’d encourage someone with more info to enhance! (John Ingold at The Colorado Sun -- johningold@coloradosun.com -- contributed much(sf) info, too.)

Colorado outsources to Lexis/Nexis at this site: https://www.cocourts.com/cocourts/
It costs $7 for a statewide search 	($2 if you only want to search in Denver; $5 if you want to search 	everywhere but Denver; $7 for a combined search), even if you come 	up with nothing.
	
CoCourts does not provide online 	access to documents. It’s only basic information like what would 	be found on a register of action.
	
To search, you need at least the 	last name and part of a first name of a party, a business name or a 	case number. If it’s a criminal thing, you probably need a DOB to 	make sure you have the right person. The main courts site is here: 	https://www.courts.state.co.us/.
	
Colorado has both county trial 	courts and district trial courts. County courts handle smaller 	matters. District courts are where felony criminal cases and major 	civil cases are heard. Dockets are often posted at the individual 	courts’ pages, available through that page.
	
There is no online access to 	documents from criminal cases in Colorado, unless the state court 	PIO posts them online under a court’s “Cases of Interest” 	page. Each district has its own Cases of Interest page, accessible 	via the district’s page www.courts.state.co.us.
	
If you are in Colorado, you can 	get documents from recent civil cases through computer terminals at 	each courthouse or in the state Supreme Court law library in 	downtown Denver (where you can also get filings in appellate cases 	from either the Colorado Court of Appeals or the Colorado Supreme 	Court). It is free to search and to read at these terminals, but 	printing costs money. If your newsroom has access to Lexis/Nexis 	File & Serve, you may also be able to get civil case documents 	there.
	
Criminal arrest histories in 	Colorado are available through the Colorado Bureau of Investigation 	at www.cbirecordscheck.com. 	These records will sometimes have final case disposition 	information, but not always.

Connecticut
(Kristin Hussey, khussey1@gmail.com, 917-533-4628; other Conn people please add/ change/ edit)
Connecticut’s Superior Court is 	where general criminal and civil action takes place. 	
	Statewide Case lookup links for all courts here: 	https://www.jud.ct.gov/jud2.htm
	
		Unless someone knows a better trick, for criminal searches 		you usually need two or three searches on the same page: 		Convictions and Pending Cases, and you can try the 		Daily Docket if the case you’re looking for is current. 		
	
	
You can search most cases by party 	name, docket number, attorney/firm juris number. 	
	
No registration required to look 	up cases; no fees for online documents. 	
	
Virtually all dockets and a most 	filings from last 5-10 years available online. 	
	
Family court posts dockets but no 	filings online. So no divorce details online, just the 	dockets.
	
Connecticut’s highest courts are 	the Appellate and Supreme Courts. You can search statewide cases 	for both in one search: 	http://appellateinquiry.jud.ct.gov/default.aspx

Delaware
Delaware contracts most, if not all, systems to LexisNexis CourtLink or File-and-Serve. An account with LexisNexis is required. Bloomberg Law has feeds of most filings in most courts.

https://courts.delaware.gov/docket.aspx
Civil court records for the Delaware Superior Court, Court of Common Pleas, and Justice of the Peace Court. Records of the Delaware Court of Chancery are not available through this service. Must go to courthouse in person for criminal records search.

District of Columbia
(Brad Heath, USA TODAY, bheath@usatoday.com)

Washington, D.C. operates its own court system to handle civil and criminal matters, and is occasionally confused with the (similarly named) federal courts in Washington.

Trial Courts
The D.C. Superior Court hears civil and criminal cases. It has a searchable index of dockets at https://eaccess.dccourts.gov/eaccess/home.page.2. The database includes detailed docket entries, and, in many cases, images of the filings themselves. Many older documents are not available remotely, even if the system indicates that an “image” is available. These are available electronically in the courthouse.

Appellate Courts
Opinions of the D.C. Court of Appeals are available at https://www.dccourts.gov/court-of-appeals/opinions-memorandum-of-judgments and are searchable on Google Scholar at https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=4,9.


Florida
(Someone who regularly does court reporting in FL, please weigh in on document access and whether accounts/payments are needed)

Lower courts:
Each county has its own clerk of 	court and online civil+criminal records available through that 	website. Some outsource to third party software vendors, some have 	bespoke systems. I haven’t personally been to all 67 but I believe 	all have some form of county court records searchable and viewable 	online. For example, Miami-Dade: 	http://www.miami-dadeclerk.com/online_services.asp. 	 	
	
There are also 20 circuit courts, 	the number is mandated by state law. Find which cover which counties 	here: 	http://www.flcourts.org/florida-courts/trial-courts-circuit.stml

District Courts of Appeal: http://onlinedocketsdca.flcourts.org/
There are five districts, all use 	the same docket search page. Refreshed once or twice a day, 	depending on which circuit. Summaries and dockets are freely 	searchable, but I believe no files are made available online.

Supreme Court: http://onlinedocketssc.flcourts.org/SearchDocket/SearchDocket
This is refreshed every 15 	minutes, and all non-confidential briefs, petitions, referee 	reports, and dispositional orders from 2015+ are available. PDFs 	available without login.

Georgia
Many counties have their own search systems; others use PeachCourt (which looks kinda like PACER for Georgia)

mycase.in.gov
This offers a county/statewide 	case search for criminal and civil filings, not sure on how far back 	it goes. Divorce information will be in there, but no details beyond 	filings, appearances, etc. 	
	
You can search by name, case 	number, attorney, but make sure you fill out as many of the fields 	as possible (including date of birth, county, civil/criminal, etc.) 	in case there are multiple folks with the same name.
	
You can find protection orders and 	no-contact orders here: https://mycourts.in.gov/porp
	
The state is *trying* to 	transition to e-file, but you’ll still have to contact individual 	county clerks for documents.

doxpop.com
This also offers a county and 	statewide case search for criminal and civil filings. Similar search 	function to MyCase. A handful of rural Indiana counties (Warrick, 	Kosciusko, etc.) that don’t submit records to MyCase will submit 	them here.
	
Doxpop’s biggest strength is 	that you can opt in to email alerts for updates on a case you’re 	following -- it’s a good tool if you need to keep tabs on a 	high-profile case.
	
Because Doxpop limits the number 	of searches you can do, it’s best to check MyCase first when 	backgrounding someone. Doxpop does have some information not on 	MyCase like a criminal defendant’s birthdate and an easily 	accessible calendar of upcoming hearing dates. 	
	
Requires you to sign up for an 	account to see details of any case. You get six free searches per 	month and don’t have to enter any credit card information unless 	you want to pay for more searches per month. Once you create an 	account, you can also sign up for alerts on cases you’re 	interested in. Navigating to those flagged cases from the My 	Doxpop-My Saved Cases tab won’t count toward your monthly search 	limit.

From Frank Boyett:
Kentucky court system links provided by Frank Boyett, retired staff writer for The Gleaner in Henderson, KY. I am willing to answer reasonable questions about how the system works and can be contacted at YesNews42@yahoo.com or on Twitter at @BoyettFrank.
For all intents and purposes, you’ll need to go to the county in question to delve into court records. Personally, I would not publish anything I got off the public access terminal; always check the paper records.
There are several exceptions, however, to my caveat about having to go to the local judicial center. The main link to the AOC Web page is https://courts.ky.gov/aoc/Pages/default.aspx which gives you background on the five different types of courts in Kentucky
You also have free access to the docket for any court in the state, for any date or place you choose:
http://kcoj.kycourts.net/dockets/
Here is the page that will tell you what you need to know to order a criminal history report on an individual, which costs $25. https://courts.ky.gov/aoc/criminalrecordreports/Pages/default.aspx
The AOC press office is also pretty good about providing custom data reports at no cost. The Web page says they provide it only in pdf form, but I’ve gotten it in Excel. They also have a lot of generic data reports. Here’s the link to the Press Office for getting reports and other stuff.
https://courts.ky.gov/aoc/statisticalreports/Pages/default.aspx
Here’s a link to a primer I wrote in 1995 about how to use the public access terminal in any Kentucky circuit court clerk’s office. It will contain way more information than you want, in all likelihood, but there are also some useful nuggets in there.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paqTuSgIpS12lkmWcs0riPARrbZKvy2Y/view?usp=sharing
It’s obviously dated, but should give you a rough idea of what’s in the system and how best to access it. Holler at me if you run across something that’s stumping you.
Most of the changes since 1995 have streamlined the system. For instance, you no longer need worry about the F command keys, nor will you need to manually enter codes to pull up various types of documents. Full dates of birth and Social Security numbers are no longer available, but you can get the last four digits of the SS number and the birth year of the person you’re interested in.

Maine

Reporters who can help: Jake Bleiberg, Bangor Daily News (jbleiberg@bangordailynews.com, @JZBlieberg)

Lower courts: In Maine, state court records are not online digitized and won’t be for years; you cannot search them online. The state’s district courts are broken down by town/city and its superior courts are split up by county, with the two busiest being those in Cumberland and Penobscot counties.

The lower courts post online some documents in some high-profile cases. These postings can lag behind when the documents were filed with the courts.

To get quick access to most case files, you must go to a courthouse in person and provide a court clerk with both parties to it or a docket number. Information on how to file a written request for a records search can be found here. These requests often take two weeks or more.

Upper court:
Maine’s top court, the Supreme 	Judicial Court, posts 	its opinions online here. 	
	
To view filings in a case before 	the court you must visit the Portland courthouse.

Maryland
(Brad Heath, USA TODAY, bheath@usatoday.com)

Trial Courts
Maryland maintains a statewide, searchable index of trial court records, dating back to at least the 1990s, available from http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/casesearch/. The index covers civil, criminal and traffic cases in district and circuit courts in each county. It is searchable by name and date. Some things to be aware of:

The index does not include 	documents. Paper filing in many jurisdictions remains fairly 	archaic. Also, the dockets for each case typically contain fairly 	terse summaries without much detail. It’s best thought of as a 	party-search index.
	
The database permits wildcard 	searches (use a “%”). 	
	
It can be scraped. 	

Appellate Courts
Maryland publishes the decisions of its appellate courts, the Court of Appeals (highest court) and the Court of Special Appeals (intermediate appellate court) at https://mdcourts.gov/opinions/opinions.
Unreported opinions from May 1, 2015 to the present are at https://mdcourts.gov/appellate/unreportedopinions.
Recordings of oral arguments in the Court of Appeals (but not the Court of Special Appeals) from 2006 to the present are at https://www.mdcourts.gov/coappeals/webcasts/webcastarchive.


Massachusetts
Reporters who can help: Ally Jarmanning, WBUR (allyjar@bu.edu, @allyjarmanning); John Hawkinson, freelance (jhawk@mit.edu, @johnhawkinson)

Knowing a docket number can tell you a lot about the case and how to direct your search. For the trial courts, the first two numbers denote the year of filing, the second two numbers denote the court according to these Court Codes. Then the case type letters are listed: CR for criminal, CV for civil, SC small claims, etc. Then the sequential docket number.
Example 1781CR00001, would be the 	first criminal case filed in Middlesex County Superior Court in 	2017.
	
Here is a spreadsheet 	version of those court codes. 	

District Courts: https://www.masscourts.org/
Unclear how well this works. 	Criminal cases aren’t available. No filings.
	
Civil dockets can be searched 	online, but users must search one court at a time. The computer 	system does not allow a statewide search. (There are more than 60 	district courts.) No actual documents are available online without 	an attorney login (and even then conversion of paper filing to 	electronic is spotty and depends on the court).
	
The court is supposed to 	eventually let people access basic criminal docket information for 	district courts online by searching docket number or filing date for 	a particular district court. The courts promised to implement that 	by the end of 2018, but it is unclear whether they will meet their 	goal. (Even then, the public would only be able to look up basic 	docket entries - not see actual documents - and wouldn’t be able 	to search by name or conduct a statewide search.) 	
	
The public can search district 	court cases by name in person using paper indexes, but there is no 	statewide index available. So, users would have to visit more than 	60+ courts in person to find out whether someone has a criminal case 	at any district court in Massachusetts.
	
One big bummer: actual filings are 	not available online.
	
Zeros and spaces are significant 	in MassCourts docket numbers, so, e.g. “17 MISC 000180” is 	correct but “17MISC000180” or “17 MISC 180” won’t work, 	although internal court systems may use a different number of 	leading zeros and paper documents may be so-marked; spaces tend to 	only appear in Land Court docket numbers.
	
Efiling continues its slow rollout 	across the MassCourts system, see 	http://www.efilema.com/active-courts.htm 	for the status of each court and jurisdiction. It’s entirely 	unclear what benefits this has for journalists, however, as it is 	somewhat of a roach 	motel.

Superior Courts: https://www.masscourts.org/
All of Massachusetts’ 	upper-level trial courts are on this page, including Superior Court 	criminal cases. Also available are dockets from the Probate and 	Family Court, Housing Court, Land Court, etc.
	
For criminal cases: you can’t 	search by name. But you can search by docket number. If you don’t 	have the docket number, you can find it by searching for the 	indictment (you’ll also need to know about when the indictment was 	filed) or asking the DA’s office. Once you’ve pulled up the 	court you want to search, go to the “case type” tab. Select 	“indictment” from the “case type” box, and select a time 	period of a month or less to search. Then scroll through to find the 	defendant’s names
	
(See generally remarks above, 	under District Courts, for other features of MassCourts) 	

Appeals Court and Supreme Judicial Court
Both are searchable here, via the 	Clerks of Court: http://ma-appellatecourts.org/. 	The website usually updates daily around 8 p.m., so often feels a 	day out of date.
	
Decisions are officially released 	at 10 a.m. by the SJC Reporter of Decisions (separate entity from 	the Clerk’s Offices); The 	@MassReports Twitter account sends out a notification 	at 8 a.m. of Published decisions that will be released that 	morning; they are posted to 	https://www.mass.gov/service-details/new-opinions 	several minutes before the Tweet goes out (and before 10 a.m.), with 	predictable URLs. 	
	
Unpublished decisions are listed 	in a PDF posted with the 10 a.m. release at the same site (e.g. List 	of Unpublished Appeals Court Decisions for August 2, 2018), 	but not otherwise noticed. It’s not possible to know with 	certainty in advance whether a case will have a published decision 	(usually if it’s interesting to the media, it will be; but then 	the one time it’s not trips you up).
	
Briefs are sometimes available 	from the docket pages on ma-appellatecourts.org, though not always. 	(I believe the alleged policy is to post them when cases are 	scheduled for oral argument? –jhawk)
	
Cases filed in the Appeals Court 	can bypass the Appeals Court and be heard directly by the SJC 	through a process called Direct Appellate Review (DAR). This occurs 	either on a DAR petition by the parties, or by the Justices of the 	SJC acting on their own to remove a case and review it directly.
	
Cases that have been decided by 	the Appeals Court can be heard by the SJC on Further Appellate 	Review (FAR), if one of the parties petitions for FAR.
	
There are separate FAR-nnnnn 	and DAR-nnnnn docket numbers for these petitions, even though 	SJC cases are ultimately docketed as SJC-nnnnn.

Michigan
(Chris Haxel, Lansing State Journal, @ChrisHaxel -- others feel free to add/clean up)

Michigan does not have a statewide case search function. Some courts can be found HERE.

Other courts have a separate website, or no website at all. District court is the lower court. Felonies start there, then move to circuit court for trial. A lightly populated county may have one district court and share its circuit court with other counties. A densely populated county may have many district courts.

For information about a circuit court or district court and whether it has online court records, check HERE.

Court of Appeals and Supreme Court
Case search is HERE.

OTIS is a Department of Corrections offender search that is useful for finding case numbers. FH is the code for a felony. FC is a capital felony. Note that names are removed from the database three years after an offender is discharged from the system, so it’s mostly useful for people still incarcerated or on probation.


Minnesota
(MaryJo Webster, maryjo.webster@startribune.com)
State District Courts
You can search for basic information on cases here: http://pa.courts.state.mn.us/default.aspx
If you are searching by a name, it will only return criminal cases that resulted in a conviction and closed civil cases that resulted in a judgment. To find cases that were dismissed or open cases, you need a case number.

There is a trick for finding open cases that were just filed in the last day or two. Start a new search by "case". In the case number field put the two-digit county number (27 is Hennepin County; 62 is Ramsey County), followed by "CR" and the two digit year (18 for 2018) and then an asterisk. For example: 27CR18*. Then at the bottom of the search screen, choose "Filed Date Rev" from the Sort By pulldown menu. This will return a limited number of the most recent cases filed. The part of the case number you didn't type is the specific number of the case. For example, let’s say the most recent case number in Hennepin is 27-CR-18-7302. So you could adjust your query a little and do something like "27CR186*" to try to get slightly older cases. To find the number for a county, try digging here: http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx

Currently the search only returns the cover sheet of a case file with basics like defendant’s name, DOB, address, the charges, attorneys names and numbers, whether there was a plea or a trial and dates and key events from the case. We’ve been told that the underlying court documents will be made fully accessible through this interface (much like PACER) at some point in the not-too-distant future.

It is possible to get a data dump of most of this information from the Minnesota Supreme Court system, however it requires a legal agreement. (Minnesota courts are exempted from the state’s public records law) Contact their media people: http://www.mncourts.gov/Media.aspx

Nebraska

County & District courts

The State of Nebraska has two search options to search cases in county and district courts. The first is their One-Time Case Search. You'll pay $15 per search even if your search returns no results and returns only a register of actions. Documents are referenced, but you can't access them through this service. This service requires you to pay before even getting to the search interface.

The search interface gives you the choice of searching an entity name or an individual's name. It will return up to 30 results (you can narrow your search by county, case type, and case year). If you get your 30 results, you are not charged anything extra to look at all 30 register of action returns.

This service can be found here:

https://www.nebraska.gov/justicecc/ccname.cgi

If you are looking for more than three cases, or if you know you will want access to actual court documents, you can can pay a $50 annual fee for access to all Nebraska.gov "subscriber services," which includes appellate and trial court case searches (and additional $1 each with no additional charges for viewing/downloading case files), with the option of viewing/downloading some case files.

To sign up for this service, you must fax an application confirmation (!). Here are the details:

Criminal cases in Superior Court: https://portal.njcourts.gov/webe4/ExternalPGPA/: This is the public, remotely accessible version of PROMIS Gavel. This version only contains cases where someone was convicted in state Superior Court of an “indictable offense” (read: felony everywhere else) and sentenced to at least a year in prison (so you won’t find cases where someone got probation, pre-trial intervention or drug court). To search PROMIS Gavel for current pending cases, or information on cases that were dismissed, you have to go in person to a county courthouse to use one of their public terminals. There is typically no official way to access copies of the actual pleadings/documents in state criminal cases as a reporter without going through the Trial Court Administrator’s Office of the courthouse where the case resides (you fill out the records request form above and email/fax to a supervisor there, in most cases), or going through the state Judiciary’s communications shop (see the contact info in the “civil court cases” section). The supervisors in the TCA offices often act as the defacto point of contact for reporters with logistical questions about court proceedings in criminal cases.

Oklahoma is still working on a years-long project to have a single, unified online court docket search through the OSCN site. Right now, it’s still split between the state-funded OSCN site and another one (ODCR) that rolled up several rural county court clerks and signed them up for a paid database. Most urban and large counties are on OSCN, as are appellate courts. More information on the integration efforts here: http://www.oscn.net/news/159/oscn-kicks-off-the-new-year-with-nine-more-district-courts-added-to-its-case-search

Vermont
Very little from Vermont state courts will appear online. The Vermont judiciary’s website is here, and decisions from the Vermont Supreme Court (which is the state’s appeals court) do get published online here. It is typically very easy to get the motions or briefs filed for a Supreme Court case by emailing the clerk, or a recording of the hearing.

Otherwise, there are six divisions of Vermont Superior Court: civil, criminal, family, environmental, probate and the judicial bureau. Most have a branch in each of the state’s counties. A calendar is published online and updated daily, which will list docket numbers, defendant names, plaintiff names if applicable, hearing type, but they are not archived. (So you can’t look up yesterday’s calendar.) The clerk’s office in the courthouses themselves have public terminals, but usually you have to go in person (or get a sympathetic clerk on the phone to do a search for you.)

Virginia

Technically, Virginia’s online court records are done on a locality-by-locality basis. However, with the exception of Fairfax County and a few other places, most localities use the state’s centralized database, found here: http://www.courts.state.va.us/. That only has basic information about the case and doesn’t have any court documents. You have to visit individual courts to look at those and pay $0.50 cents a page in order to copy the records. (You can also try, of course, to get them from attorneys handling the cases.)

If you’re using Virginia’s online database, you have to look at an individual court-by-court basis. You can also do a statewide circuit court search here, on a website that isn’t maintained by the Commonwealth: http://vacircuitcourtsearch.com/.

Closed case data -- including information on Circuit and District criminal and Civil case outcomes in nearly all counties/cities in Virginia -- from 2000 to the present are available for bulk download here: https://virginiacourtdata.org This is an open data project supported by volunteers; they are willing to share more fields with reporters and to help with some analysis. (added by Meghan Hoyer, AP, mhoyer@ap.org)

From Jeff South: The Daily Press of Newport News sued the state, trying to force it to routinely release the data that has been scraped and posted at virginiacourtdata.org. The lawsuit was unsuccessful, but this year, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation instructing court officials to “make nonconfidential court records or reports of aggregated, nonconfidential case data available to the public upon request.” The law took effect July 1. Unfortunately, it does not cover civil cases, and the state’s data will omit names and DOBs of defendants. So there likely still will be a need for virginiacourtdata.org.


Washington

courts.wa.gov has statewide information on case history only, with a name search and case number search option.

The Washington Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals publish all of their opinions online here: http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/index.cfm?fa=opinions.recent

Some counties have better online access to trial court criminal case files. For example:
Pierce County Superior Court 	system: Pierce 	County Superior Court 	
	
King County Electronic 	Court Records (Seattle): online 	access to King County Superior Court case documents is limited to 	adult criminal, certain civil, final orders in domestic cases and 	probate cases that were filed after November 1, 2004.
	
You 		cannot view: 		Sealed documents or 		cases, guardianship cases, domestic violence and anti-harassment 		protection order cases, domestic relations cases (divorce, legal 		separation, child support, etc.) with the exception of final 		orders, adoptions or parentage cases, mental illness cases, 		juvenile cases or judgment cases online.
		
You 		can also request and pay for document copies at 		https://dja-eweb.kingcounty.gov/records/

State report started by: Paul Burke, scourts@globe1234.com http://www.globe1234.info/medicare/about

Summary:
The only court documents online for the public are Supreme Court briefs, opinions and calendar, and lower court orders in large class actions and some business cases. Nine counties have online files of all documents, which lawyers can access. Otherwise files are only at the court clerk's office; staff will mail them to you if you know what you want.

US Chamber of Commerce publishes news about WV civil cases since November 2005: https://wvrecord.com/ They have a good search box, and the articles tell you the parties, which county a case is in and sometimes the case number. They are owned by the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, and have similar sites for cases in N. California, Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, SE. Texas, Cook County, St. Louis, and Madison/St.Clair.

WV Municipal Courts
Each town has one for traffic, building code, zoning, dogs, noise, alcohol, etc. Judges are typically part-time in smaller towns, usually appointed by the city, otherwise elected, and might or might not be lawyers. Each town keeps its own records, off-line.

WV County Courts
This is the old name for County Commissions, which have both executive and legislative authority in each county. They no longer have judicial powers except for canvassing elections, deciding property tax appeals and settling Probate. Records are kept by the County Administrator, if any, and by the County Clerk.

WV Magistrate Courts
There are 2-10 magistrates per county for domestic violence initial hearings, small claims, warrants, bail, etc. Elected nonpartisan for 4-year terms, often not lawyers. A Magistrate Clerk keeps records, and is appointed by the chief judge of the local Circuit Court. Smaller counties with only 2 magistrates may have these clerk duties performed by the county's Circuit Clerk. Decisions appealed to Circuit Court.

WV Family Courts
Each covers 1 or more counties (see map). Elected nonpartisan for 8-year terms. They sit in each county and records for that county's cases are kept by the Circuit Clerk of that county (below). Decisions appealed to Circuit Court, unless both sides agree to go straight to State Supreme Court

WV Business Court Division
It includes seven Circuit judges, who sit throughout the state, and also hear non-business cases. Any party can ask the state Chief Justice to move a Circuit Court case to the Business Division. Orders and a few filings are online for the public and can be searched by name, number, judge or county. Other motions and briefs can be found in the relevant Circuit Clerk's office, named in the first line of any order.

WV Mass Litigation Panel
It includes seven Circuit judges. Any party can ask the state Chief Justice to move a class action case from Circuit Court to the Mass Litigation Panel. The list of cases is online, as well as orders. The first line of any order says which of three counties keeps records of that case (Kanawha, Ohio or Raleigh). The docket and other motions and briefs are electronic (though these 3 counties do not e-file local cases), and are on a public terminal in that Circuit Clerk's office.
http://www.courtswv.gov/lower-courts/mlp/overview.html
http://www.courtswv.gov/lower-courts/mlp/orders.html

WV Circuit Clerks
Officially Clerk of the Circuit Court, they keep records of Circuit and Family courts as well as Business and Mass Litigation. Elected for 6-year terms (not same as County Clerk, who is officially Clerk of the County Commission).

Nine of the 55 counties started electronic filing in 2013 or later (see status link below). Lawyers can access e-files from their offices. The public can use a terminal in participating Circuit Clerks' offices to search that county's cases. There is no schedule for making electronic files available to the public online; they may have to be filtered to remove social security numbers and other identifiers. Lawyers already remove identifiers from federal filings before e-filing on PACER, but no one has told them to do that in WV yet.

Other counties and older files are on paper, and the oldest cases may be in storage and need time to access.

Copies of paper or electronic records are $1 per page, and Circuit Clerks will normally mail copies of the docket, filings and orders to you for that price. If you need a lot of pages it might be worth asking a lawyer for them.

WV State Supreme Court of Appeals
Five justices elected nonpartisan for 12-year terms. Hearings are webcast but not kept. You can also listen by phone, 304-558-1313. Records are kept by the Supreme Court Clerk. Opinions since September 1991 are online by date. Briefs since November 2004 are online under the "Argument Docket" for the date of the hearing. If you do not know dates, you can put some or all of the case title and "site:courtswv.gov" into your favorite search engine (for example: Rissler Zoning site:courtswv.gov). If the case is widely cited by later cases, limit the search to a range of dates to get back to the original documents. If you find the opinion, it shows the date of the hearing as "Submitted." The paper file at the court also includes a copy of the lower court record, and can be copied for $1 per page (25 cents in pending cases). Old cases are on microfilm, and you can buy a copy of the whole microfilm or pay $2 per page for printing parts of it.
