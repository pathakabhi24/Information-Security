# Windows-auditing-mindmap

## Project purpose
**Windows auditing mindmap** provides a simplified view of Windows Event logs and auditing capacities that enables defenders to enhance visibility for different purposes:
* Log collection (eg: into a SIEM)
* Threat hunting
* Forensic / DFIR
* Troubleshooting

## Active mindmaps
The following mindmaps are currently provided:
* Windows OS auditing baseline
* Windows Server roles auditing (also covers SQL Server and Advanced Threat Analytics)
* Active Directory (ADDS) auditing
* Microsoft Azure
* Exchange Server 2016/2019 auditing

# Windows OS auditing baseline
